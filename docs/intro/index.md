# Spark: AI-Powered Documentation Generation

Spark is an innovative command-line tool designed to automate the process of generating high-quality documentation for your software projects. By leveraging powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), Spark analyzes your repository's source code and contextual information to produce comprehensive, structured, and developer-friendly Markdown documentation files.

## Why Spark?

Traditional documentation is often an afterthought, becoming outdated quickly or never written at all. Spark addresses this challenge by:

*   **Automating Content Creation:** Eliminates the manual effort of writing documentation from scratch, freeing developers to focus on coding.
*   **Ensuring Consistency:** Generates documentation following a consistent structure and tone, as defined by its internal prompting mechanisms.
*   **Staying Up-to-Date:** Can be easily re-run to generate updated documentation as your codebase evolves.
*   **Leveraging Context:** Understands your code's intent and structure by directly analyzing the source files, producing relevant and accurate explanations.

Spark aims to be a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit, promoting better project understanding and maintainability through effortlessly generated, context-rich documentation.

## Key Features

*   **Source Code Analysis:** Reads and understands your project's files.
*   **AI-Powered Generation:** Utilizes generative AI models (like Google Gemini) to craft detailed explanations.
*   **Modular Output:** Produces organized Markdown files categorized for easy navigation.
*   **Configurable Ignored Files:** Respects `.gitignore` and `.sparkignore` to avoid processing irrelevant files.
*   **Simple Command-Line Interface:** Easy to install and run with a single command.

Get started with Spark to transform your codebase into well-documented projects effortlessly.
